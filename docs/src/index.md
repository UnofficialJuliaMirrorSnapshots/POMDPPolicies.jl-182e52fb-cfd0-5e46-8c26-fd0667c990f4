# About

POMDPPolicies provides a collection of policy types for [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl).

It currently provides:
- an alpha vector policy type
- a random policy
- a stochastic policy type
- a vector policy type
- a wrapper to collect statistics and errors about policies

In addition, it provides the [`showpolicy`](@ref) function for printing policies similar to the way that matrices are printed in the repl.
